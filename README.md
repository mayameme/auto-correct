A brief background to my research about ML, AI and ethics


My PhD research is grounded in a Science and Technology Studies approach (a good description is here: http://sts.hks.harvard.edu/about/whatissts.html ), and investigates the relationship between ethics and accountability in human-machine systems. I look at this relationship through different kinds of tests and testing of humans and machines (ML applications, actually). One of these tests is ethics, the other is the law, and both are applied to humans and machines; I'm interested in how similar or different the tests are for machines and humans.
